# 🎵 Chinook Database SQL Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the **Chinook Database**, which stores information about a music store, including artists, albums, tracks, customers, employees, and invoices. The goal is to query the database to gain insights into sales, media types, and customer behavior.  

## 🛠️ Getting Started  

### 1⃣ Set Up the Chinook Database  
You can run the database using **DB Browser for SQLite** or **PostgreSQL**:  
- **Option 1: DB Browser for SQLite** – Download and open the `.sqlite` database file.  
- **Option 2: PostgreSQL** – Import the database and connect via a SQL client.  

### 2⃣ Running SQL Queries  
Complete the SQL question sets by running queries on the Chinook database. These queries will help analyze:  
- Music media types  
- Popular artists and albums  
- Customer purchase behavior  
- Employee and invoice details  

### 3⃣ Data Visualization & Presentation  
- Extract meaningful insights from the queried data.  
- Create **charts and graphs** (bar charts, histograms, etc.) to illustrate findings.  
- Present the results in **PowerPoint or Google Slides**.  

## 📊 Chinook Database Schema  
The Chinook Database contains multiple tables, including:  
- **Artist** – Stores artist names.  
- **Album** – Links albums to artists.  
- **Track** – Contains music track details (genre, media type, duration, price).  
- **Customer & Employee** – Stores customer and employee data.  
- **Invoice & InvoiceLine** – Tracks sales and transactions.  

## 🔧 Requirements  
Ensure you have the following before running queries:  
- **SQLite or PostgreSQL**  
- **SQL Query Tool** (DB Browser, DBeaver, or pgAdmin)  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chinook-sql-analysis.git
   cd chinook-sql-analysis
   ```  
2. Load the Chinook database into your SQL tool.  
3. Execute queries from the provided `.sql` file.  
4. Analyze the results and create a presentation.
